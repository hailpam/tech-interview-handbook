# Graphs
Graphs are pervasive in our daily lifes. Most of the social networks exploit graph theories to provide complex services for their users. 
Examples of important algorithms when it comes to Graphs are distance, search, connectivity, cycle detection, Depth First Search (DPS) and Breadth First Search (BFS). The most used representations for Graphs are adjacency lists and ajacency matrices.
