# Back of the Envelope Calculations

## Fermi Estimation

Also known as Fermi Estimation, it allows to make educated guesses using real world data and observations. Very useful when architecting systems and decisions need to be taken for alternatives.

## Pareto Law

80/20 law.

## Order of Magnitudes

TBD - for distributed sytems, thinks like disk access time, latency, etc.
